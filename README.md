# Tic-tac-toe-CODSOFT
Projects of C++



I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed #Task2 of my C++ Programming Internship (Virtual) at CodSoft !! 🚀

This project highlights key features and functionalities of C++:

✨ Interactive Game Board Display: Implements a visually appealing 3x3 game board that updates dynamically with each move.

👨‍💻 Player Move Validation: Ensures valid moves by checking player input and board state, preventing invalid placements.

🏆 Win and Draw Detection: Contains logic to check for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and detect a draw scenario, enhancing game accuracy.

🔄 Smooth Gameplay Loop: Manages turn-based gameplay for two players ('X' and 'O'), switching turns seamlessly after each valid move.

🎉 Replay Option: Offers players the choice to play again after a game concludes, providing an engaging and continuous experience.

💡 Key C++ Concepts: Demonstrates the use of vectors, functions, loops, conditionals, and input/output operations.

Building this game was a great way to reinforce my C++ skills and have some fun along the way. Try it out and see if you can beat your opponent! 🎉
